                        <p className='pg7style12'>Organic food, ecological food, or biological food are foods and drinks produced by methods
                         complying with the standards of organic farming. Standards vary worldwide, but organic farming features practices that 
                         cycle resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity. Organizations regulating organic products may
                          restrict the use of certain pesticides and fertilizers in the farming methods used to produce such products. Organic 
                          foods are typically not processed using irradiation, industrial solvents, or synthetic food additives</p>
                          <p className='pg7style12'>From an environmental perspective, fertilizing, overproduction, and the use of pesticides
                           in conventional farming may negatively affect ecosystems, soil health,[4][5] biodiversity, groundwater, and drinking 
                           water supplies. These environmental and health issues are intended to be minimized or avoided in organic farming</p>
